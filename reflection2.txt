-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This repository becomes a git repository which now has all the git features to keep track 
on the development of the folder.


-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When one wants to create a new feature off from the main branch but still has a git feature to keep track of the commits history.
When you are moving on to a new feature. Think of it like a context switching.
Master branch is the production branch which has production quality and the other branches are the development branches.
Gives you the ability to switch and work on new features simultaneously.
